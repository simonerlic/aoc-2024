# My 2024 Advent of Code

Thought it would be nice to put my AoC attempts in a public repo this year, so here we are!
I've decided to write it in Swift this year and even set up a nice boilerplate/runner to make it more convenient for myself.

I'll post my code after finishing both parts of the day.

Let's see how this goes!

## Running my code

Make sure you have Swift installed on your machine. You can download it from [here](https://swift.org/download/).

To run the code, simply run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
swift run AoC2024
```

This will run the code for the current day. If you want to run the code for a specific day, you can pass the day number as an argument:

```bash
swift run AoC2024 01
```

Which will run the code for day 1.

You can also choose to run the code on the test input by passing the `--test` flag:

```bash
swift run AoC2024 --test
```
